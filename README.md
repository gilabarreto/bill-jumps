# Bill Jumps

A re-creation of a popular offline game found in Chrome, Bill Jumps uses Bill to jump over chairs in a manner reminiscent of his iconic 90s video, not a dinosaur. Pressing the space key will allow the player to control Bill as he leaps over chairs. Designed to be fun and entertaining, this game is sure to delight any player.

This project was build with HTML, CSS and JS in order to practise my front-end skills and have some fun. :-)
